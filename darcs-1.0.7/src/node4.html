<H1><A NAME="SECTION00400000000000000000">
Getting started</A>
</H1>

<P>
This chapter will lead you through an example use of darcs, which hopefully
will allow you to get started using darcs with your project.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00410000000000000000">
Creating your repository</A>
</H1>

<P>
Creating your repository in the first place just involves telling darcs to
create the special directory (called <TT>_darcs</TT>) in your project tree,
which will hold the revision information.  This is done by simply calling
from the root directory of your project:
<PRE>
% cd my_project/
% darcs initialize
</PRE>
This creates the <code>_darcs</code> directory and populates it with whatever
files and directories are needed to describe an empty project.  You now
need to tell darcs what files and directories in your project should be
under revision control.  You do this using the command <code>darcs add</code><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot199"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>:
<PRE>
% darcs add *.c Makefile.am configure.ac
</PRE>
When you have added all your files (or at least, think you have), you will
want to record your changes.  ``Recording'' always includes adding a note
as to why the change was made, or what it does.  In this case, we'll just
note that this is the initial version.
<PRE>
% darcs record --all
What is the patch name? Initial revision.
</PRE>
Note that since we didn't specify a patch name on the command line we were
prompted for one.  If the environment variable `EMAIL' isn't set, you will
also be prompted for your email address.  Each patch that is recorded is
given a unique identifier consisting of the patch name, its creator's email
address, and the date when it was created.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00420000000000000000">
Making changes</A>
</H1>

<P>
Now that we have created our repository, make a change to one or more of
your files.  After making the modification run:
<PRE>
% darcs whatsnew
</PRE>
This should show you the modifications that you just made, in the darcs
patch format.  If you prefer to see your changes in a different format,
read Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#whatsnew"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="./crossref.png"></A>, which describes the whatsnew command in
detail.

<P>
Let's say you have now made a change to your project.  The next thing to do
is to record a patch.  Recording a patch consists of grouping together a
set of related changes, and giving them a name.  It also tags the patch
with the date it was recorded and your email address.

<P>
To record a patch simply type:
<PRE>
% darcs record
</PRE>
darcs will then prompt you with all the changes that you have made that
have not yet been recorded, asking you which ones you want to include in
the new patch.  Finally, darcs will ask you for a name for the patch.

<P>
You can now rerun whatsnew, and see that indeed the changes you have
recorded are no longer marked as new.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00430000000000000000">
Making your repository visible to others</A>
</H1>
How do you let the world know about these wonderful changes?  Obviously,
they must be able to see your repository.  Currently the easiest way to do
this is typically by http using any web server.  The recommended way to do
this (using apache in a UNIX environment) is to create a directory called
<TT>/var/www/repos</TT>, and then put a symlink to your repository there:
<PRE>
% cd /var/www/repos
% ln -s /home/username/myproject .
</PRE>

<P>
As long as you're running a web server and making your repository available to
the world, you may as well make it easy for people to see what changes
you've made.  You can do this by running <code>make installserver</code>, which
installs the program <code>darcs_cgi</code> at <code>/usr/lib/cgi-bin/darcs</code>.  You
also will need to create a cache directory named
<code>/var/cache/darcs_cgi</code>, and make sure the owner of that directory is
the same user that your web server runs its cgi scripts as.  For me,
this is www-data.  Now your friends and enemies should be able to easily
browse your repositories by pointing their web browsers at
<code>http://your.server.org/cgi-bin/darcs</code>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00440000000000000000">
Getting changes made to another repository</A>
</H1>
Ok, so I can now browse your repository using my web browser... so
what? How do I get your changes into <SPAN  CLASS="textit">my</SPAN> repository, where they can
do some good? It couldn't be easier.  I just <code>cd</code> into my repository,
and there type:
<PRE>
% darcs pull http://your.server.org/repos/yourproject
</PRE>
Darcs will check to see if you have recorded any changes that aren't in my
current repository.  If so, it'll prompt me for each one, to see which ones
I want to add to my repository.  Note that you may see a different series
of prompts depending on your answers, since sometimes one patch depends on
another, so if you answer yes to the first one, you won't be prompted for
the second if the first depends on it.

<P>
Of course, maybe I don't even have a copy of your repository.  In that case
I'd want to do a
<PRE>
% darcs get http://your.server.org/repos/yourproject
</PRE>
which gets the whole repository.

<P>
I could instead create an empty repository and fetch all of your patches
with pull.  Get is just a more efficient way to clone a whole repository.

<P>
Get, pull and push also work over ssh.  Ssh-paths are of the same form
accepted by scp, namely <code>[username@]host:/path/to/repository</code>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00450000000000000000">
Moving patches from one repository to another</A>
</H1>

<P>
Darcs is flexible as to how you move patches from one repository to another.
This section will introduce all the ways you can get patches from one place
to another, starting with the simplest and moving to the most complicated.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00451000000000000000">
All pulls</A>
</H2>

<P>
The simplest method is the ``all-pull'' method.  This involves making each
repository readable (by http, ftp, nfs-mounted disk, whatever), and you
run <code>darcs pull</code> in the repository you want to move the patch to.  This is nice,
as it doesn't require you to give write access to anyone else, and is
reasonably simple.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00452000000000000000">
Send and apply manually</A>
</H2>

<P>
Sometimes you have a machine on which it is not convenient to set up a web
server, perhaps because it's behind a firewall or perhaps for security
reasons, or because it is often turned off.  In this case you can use
<code>darcs send</code>
from that computer to generate a patch bundle destined for another
repository.  You can either let darcs email the patch for you, or save it
as a file and transfer it by hand.  Then in the destination repository you
(or the owner of that repository) run <code>darcs apply</code> to apply the patches contained
in the bundle.  This is also quite a simple method since, like the all-pull
method, it doesn't require that you give anyone write access to your
repository.  But it's less convenient, since you have to keep track of the
patch bundle (in the email, or whatever).

<P>
If you use the send and apply method with email, you'll probably want to
create a <code>_darcs/prefs/email</code> file containing your email address.
This way anyone who sends to your repository will automatically send the
patch bundle to your email address.

<P>
If you receive many patches by email, you probably will benefit by running
darcs apply directly from your mail program.  I have in my <code>.muttrc</code>
the following
<PRE>
macro pager A "&lt;pipe-entry&gt;darcs apply --verbose --mark-conflicts \
        --reply droundy@abridgegame.org --repodir ~/darcs"
</PRE>
which allows me to apply patches directly from <code>mutt</code>, sending a
confirmation email to the person who sent me the patch.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00453000000000000000">
Push</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you use ssh (and preferably also ssh-agent, so you won't have to keep
retyping your password), you can use the push method to transfer changes
(using the scp protocol for communication).  This method is again not very
complicated, since you presumably already have the ssh permissions set up.
Push can also be used when the target repository is local, in which case
ssh isn't needed.  On the other hand, in this situation you could as easily
run a pull, so there isn't much benefit.

<P>
Note that you can use push to administer a multiple-user repository.  You
just need to create a user for the repository (or repositories), and give
everyone with write access ssh access, perhaps using
<code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.  Then they run
<PRE>
% darcs push repouser@repo.server:repo/directory
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00454000000000000000">
Push --apply-as</A>
</H2>

<P>
Now we get more subtle.  If you like the idea in the previous paragraph
about creating a repository user to own a repository which is writable by
a number of users, you have one other option.

<P>
Push <code>--apply-as</code> can run on either a local repository or one accessed
with ssh, but uses <code>sudo</code> to run a darcs apply command (having created
a patch bundle as in send) as another user.  You can add the following line
in your <code>sudoers</code> file to allow the users to apply their patches to a
centralized repository:
<PRE>
ALL   ALL = (repo-user) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/darcs apply --all --repodir /repo/path*
</PRE>
This method is ideal for a centralized repository when all the users have
accounts on the same computer, if you don't want your users to be able to
run arbitrary commands as repo-user.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00455000000000000000">
Sending signed patches by email</A>
</H2>

<P>
Most of the previous methods are a bit clumsy if you don't want to give
each person with write access to a repository an account on your server.  Darcs
send can be configured to send a cryptographically signed patch by email.
You can then set up your mail system to have darcs verify that patches were
signed by an authorized user and apply them when a patch is received by
email.  The results of the apply can be returned to the user by email.
Unsigned patches (or patches signed by unauthorized users) will be
forwarded to the repository owner (or whoever you configure them to be
forwarded to...).

<P>
This method is especially nice when combined with the <code>--test</code> option
of darcs apply, since it allows you to run the test suite (assuming you
have one) and reject patches that fail--and it's all done on the server,
so you can happily go on working on your development machine without
slowdown while the server runs the tests.

<P>
Setting up darcs to run automatically in response to email is by far the
most complicated way to get patches from one repository to another... so it'll
take a few sections to explain how to go about it.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00455010000000000000">
Security considerations</A>
</H4>

<P>
When you set up darcs to run apply on signed patches, you should assume
that a user with write access can write to any file or directory that is
writable by the user under which the apply process runs.  Unless you
specify the <code>--no-test</code> flag to darcs apply (and this is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN>
the default), you are also allowing anyone with write access to that
repository to run arbitrary code on your machine (since they can run a test
suite--which they can modify however they like).  This is quite a
potential security hole.

<P>
For these reasons, if you don't implicitly trust your users, it is
recommended that you create a user for each repository to limit the damage
an attacker can do with access to your repository.  When considering who to
trust, keep in mind that a security breach on any developer's machine could
give an attacker access to their private key and passphrase, and thus to
your repository.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00455020000000000000">
Installing necessary programs</A>
</H4>

<P>
You also must install the following programs: gnupg, a mailer configured to
receive mail (e.g. exim, sendmail or postfix), and a web server (usually
apache).  If you want to be able to browse your repository on the web you
must also configure your web server to run cgi scripts and make sure the
darcs cgi script was properly installed (by either a darcs-server package,
or `make install-server').

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00455030000000000000">
Granting access to a repository</A>
</H4>

<P>
You create your gpg key by running (as your normal user):
<PRE>
% gpg --gen-key
</PRE>
You will be prompted for your name and email address, among other options.
To add your public key to the allowed keys keyring.  Of course, you can
skip this step if you already have a gpg key you wish to use.

<P>
You now need to export the public key so we can tell the patcher about it.
You can do this with the following command (again as your normal user):
<PRE>
% gpg --export "email@address" &gt; /tmp/exported_key
</PRE>
And now we can add your key to the <code>allowed_keys</code>:
<PRE>
(as root)&gt; gpg --keyring /var/lib/darcs/repos/myproject/allowed_keys \
               --no-default-keyring --import /tmp/exported_key
</PRE>
You can repeat this process any number of times to authorize multiple users
to send patches to the repository.

<P>
You should now be able to send a patch to the repository by running as your
normal user, in a working copy of the repository:
<PRE>
% darcs send --sign http://your.computer/repos/myproject
</PRE>
You may want to add ``send sign'' to the file <code>_darcs/prefs/defaults</code>
so that you won't need to type <code>--sign</code> every time you want to
send...

<P>
If your gpg key is protected by a passphrase, then executing <code>send</code>
with the <code>--sign</code> option might give you the following error:
<PRE>
darcs failed:  Error running external program 'gpg'
</PRE>
The most likely cause of this error is that you have a misconfigured
gpg that tries to automatically use a non-existent gpg-agent
program. GnuPG will still work without gpg-agent when you try to sign
or encrypt your data with a passphrase protected key. However, it will
exit with an error code 2 (<code>ENOENT</code>) causing <code>darcs</code> to
fail. To fix this, you will need to edit your <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>
file and comment out or remove the line that says:
<PRE>
use-agent
</PRE>
If after commenting out or removing the <code>use-agent</code> line in your
gpg configuration file you still get the same error, then you probably
have a modified GnuPG with use-agent as a hard-coded option. In that
case, you should change <code>use-agent</code> to <code>no-use-agent</code> to
disable it explicitly.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00455040000000000000">
Setting up a sendable repository using procmail</A>
</H4>
If you don't have root access on your machine, or perhaps simply don't want
to bother creating a separate user, you can set up a darcs repository using
procmail to filter your mail.  I will assume that you already use procmail
to filter your email.  If not, you will need to read up on it, or perhaps
should use a different method for routing the email to darcs.

<P>
To begin with, you must configure your repository so that a darcs send to
your repository will know where to send the email.  Do this by creating a
file in <code>/path/to/your/repo/_darcs/prefs</code> called <code>email</code>
containing your email address.  As a trick (to be explained below), we will
create the email address with ``darcs repo'' as your name, in an email
address of the form ``David Roundy <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$&lt;$"></SPAN>droundy@abridgegame.org<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$&gt;$"></SPAN>.''
<PRE>
% echo 'my darcs repo &lt;user@host.com&gt;' \
      &gt; /path/to/your/repo/_darcs/prefs/email
</PRE>

<P>
The next step is to set up a gnupg keyring containing the public keys of
people authorized to send to your repository.  Here I'll give a second way of
going about this (see above for the first).  This time I'll assume you
want to give me write access to your repository.  You can do this by:
<PRE>
gpg --no-default-keyring \
    --keyring /path/to/the/allowed_keys --recv-keys D3D5BCEC
</PRE>
This works because ``D3D5BCEC'' is the ID of my gpg key, and I have
uploaded my key to the gpg keyservers.  Actually, this also requires that
you have configured gpg to access a valid keyserver.  You can, of course,
repeat this command for all keys you want to allow access to.

<P>
Finally, we add a few lines to your <code>.procmailrc</code>:
<PRE>
:0:
* ^TOmy darcs repo
|(umask 022; darcs apply --reply user@host.com \
    --repodir /path/to/your/repo --verify /path/to/the/allowed_keys)
</PRE>
The purpose for the ``my darcs repo'' trick is partially to make it easier
to recognize patches sent to the repository, but is even more crucial to
avoid nasty bounce loops by making the <code>--reply</code> option have an email
address that won't go back to the repository.  This means that unsigned
patches that are sent to your repository will be forwarded to your ordinary
email.

<P>
I find that I need the ``umask 022'' in order to keep procmail from setting
the umask incorrectly, which causes the repository to no longer be
world-readable.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00455050000000000000">
Checking if your e-mail patch was applied</A>
</H4>

<P>
After sending a patch with <code>darcs send</code>, you may not receive any feedback,
even if the patch is applied. You can confirm whether or not your patch was applied
to the remote repository by pointing <code>darcs changes</code> at a remote repository:
<PRE>
darcs changes --last=10 --repo=http://abridgegame.org/repos/darcs
</PRE>

<P>
That shows you the last 10 changes in the remote repository. You can adjust the options given
to <code>changes</code> if a more advanced query is needed.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00460000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="disk-usage"></A>
<BR>
Reducing disk space usage
</H1>

<P>
A Darcs repository contains the patches that Darcs uses to store
history, the working directory, and a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pristine tree</SPAN> (a copy of
the working directory files with no local modifications).  For large
repositories, this can add up to a fair amount of disk usage.

<P>
There are two techniques that can be used to reduce the amount of
space used by Darcs repositories: linking and using no pristine tree.
The former can be used on any repository; the latter is only suitable
in special circumstances, as it makes some operations much slower.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00461000000000000000">
Linking between repositories</A>
</H2>

<P>
A number of filesystems support <SPAN  CLASS="textit">linking</SPAN> files, sharing a
single file data between different directories.  Under some
circumstances, when repositories are very similar (typically because
they represent different branches of the same piece of software),
Darcs will use linking to avoid storing the same file multiple times.

<P>
Whenever you invoke <code>darcs get</code> to copy a repository from a local
filesystem onto the same filesystem, Darcs will link patches whenever
possible.

<P>
In order to save time, <code>darcs get</code> does not link pristine trees
even when individual files are identical.  Additionally, as you pull
patches into trees, patches will become unlinked.  This will result in
a lot of wasted space if two repositories have been living for a long
time but are similar.  In such a case, you should <SPAN  CLASS="textit">relink</SPAN> files
between the two repositories.

<P>
Relinking is an asymmetric operation: you relink one repository (to
which you must have write access) to another repository, called the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">sibling</SPAN>.  This is done with <code>darcs optimize --relink</code>, with
-the <code>--sibling</code> flag specifying the sibling.
<PRE>
  $ cd /var/repos/darcs-unstable
  $ darcs optimize --relink --sibling /var/repos/darcs
</PRE>
The <code>--sibling</code> flag can be repeated multiple times, in which
case Darcs will try to find a file to link to in all of the siblings.
If a default repository is defined, Darcs will try, as a last resort,
to link against the default repository.

<P>
Additional space savings can be achieved by relinking files in the
pristine tree (see below) by using the <code>--relink-pristine</code> flag.
However, doing this prevents Darcs from having precise timestamps on
the pristine files, which carries a moderate performance penalty.

Alternate formats for the pristine tree</A>
</H2>

<P>
By default, every Darcs repository contains a complete copy of the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">pristine tree</SPAN>, the working tree as it would be if there were no
local edits.  By avoiding the need to consult a possibly large number
of patches just to find out if a file is modified, the pristine tree
makes a lot of operations much faster than they would otherwise be.

<P>
Under some circumstances, keeping a whole pristine tree is not
desirable.  This is the case when preparing a repository to back up,
when publishing a repository on a public web server with limited
space, or when storing a repository on floppies or small USB keys.  In
such cases, it is possible to use a repository with no pristine tree.

<P>
Darcs automatically recognizes a repository with no pristine
tree.  In order to create such a tree, specify the
<code>--no-pristine-tree</code> flag to <code>darcs initialize</code> or
<code>darcs get</code>.  There is currently no way to switch an existing
repository to use no pristine tree.

<P>
The support for <code>--no-pristine-tree</code> repositories is fairly new,
and has not been extensively optimized yet.  Please let us know if you
use this functionality, and which operations you find are too slow.
